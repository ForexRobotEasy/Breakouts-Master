# Breakouts Master

This code is a sample implementation of a trading expert advisor (EA) called Breakouts Master. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy team and is designed to trade breakouts in the forex market.

## Product Description

Breakouts Master is a forex trading EA that specializes in identifying and trading breakouts in the market. It is a fully automated trading system that aims to capitalize on the potential profits that can be made when price breaks above a resistance level or below a support level.

With Breakouts Master, traders can benefit from its ability to automatically open buy and sell trades when price breaks above or below key levels. The EA also features a fixed stop loss and take profit level to help manage risk and protect profits.

## Features

- Breakout trading strategy: The EA identifies breakouts in the market and opens trades accordingly.
- Fixed stop loss and take profit: The EA utilizes a fixed stop loss and take profit level to manage risk and protect profits.
- Automatic trading: Breakouts Master is a fully automated trading system that executes trades on behalf of the trader.
- Reinvestment of profits: The EA offers an option to reinvest profits for further trading, allowing for potential compounding of earnings.

## How It Works

### Initialization

The EA initializes by enabling trading and setting the expert magic number for identification. It also sets the fixed stop loss and take profit levels.

### Trading Logic

The EA's trading logic is executed on each tick of the market. It calculates the trading volume based on the size of the deposit and the earned profit.

If the price breaks above a resistance level, the EA opens a buy trade and updates the earned profit. Similarly, if the price breaks below a support level, the EA opens a sell trade and updates the earned profit.

### Reinvestment of Profits

The EA provides a function to reinvest profits for further trading. It calculates the reinvestment volume based on the size of the deposit and the earned profit. The trading volume for future trades is then increased.

### Stop Trading

When necessary, the EA stops trading. This can be triggered by certain events or conditions. When the EA is deactivated, it closes all open trades and prints the total earned profit.
